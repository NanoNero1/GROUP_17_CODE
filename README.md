THIS IS THE README FOR THE GITHUB PAGE OF PROJECT 17
TEAM MEMBERS: DIMITRI KACHLER, ALIND GUPTA

the folder "P17_KACHLER_GUPTA" is a mirror of the file uploaded to MOODLE
Because github has a 25Mb file limit, we cant upload the Godot Project to the github, hence we are hosting it on Google Drive:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dFWJSemMXiKZOprwqlKSlfSJf_an2O1Y/view?usp=sharing

To play the game, unzip the folder make your way to the folder /ARIO_2 and then you can execute finalBuild.exe to play the game.
The control are left-arrow and right-arrow to go left and right, and then spacebar to jump.
